INTRODUCTION
============
Forecasting:
   - average -> very bad
   - moving average -> take only the last X time units to calculate the average (for instance, 12 months)
   - naive method -> take last value as estimator of the next one
   - exponential smoothing

Time series trends:
   - downtrend
   - uptrend
   - horizontal trend

Seasonality
   - common pattern across many different types of time series
   - cyclical vs seasonality
       - cyclical: no fixed period
       - seasonal: unchanging and associated with some aspect of the calendar
       - a time series can have both components, one of them or neither


ETS MODELS
==========
Weighted averaged of past observations
Time series decomposition:
     - error (observed value - trendline estimated)
     - trend
     - seasonality

Additive vs Multiplicative behaviour
     - additive (linear): trend and seasonal variation are releatively constant
     - multiplicative (exponential):   "               increase or decrease in magnitude over time
     

ETS models:
    - Simple Exponential Smoothing Method
      * neither trend nor seasonal component
      * average over past periods with a smoothing parameter alpha
      * http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/computation.html#exponentially-weighted-windows
    - Holt's Linear Trend Method
      * also known as double exponential smoothing
      * works fine for non seasonal data
      * uses level and trend additively
    - Exponential Trend Method
      * non seasonal data
      * user level and trend multiplicatly. This way, level and trend will increase/decrease exponentially rather than linear
    - Holt-Winters Seasonal Method
      * takes into account seasonal, trend and level component	

ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average)
=====
Types:
   - non seasonal
   - seasonal

ARIMA = (p d q)  -> number of periods to consider
      AR -> autoregressive terms
      I -> differencing == transforming the time series into an stationary one, that is, a signal with constant mean and variance 
      MA -> moving average -> lag of the error component (error = part not explained by trend or seasonality)


ACP (autocorrelation plot) 
    - autocorrelation with past values
    - allows to decide whether to use AR, AM or both
      - AR
      	* use it when the ACP decreases sharply after a few lags
      	* predicts based on the past values of the variable
      - MA
      	* ACP decrease more gradually


ARIMA non-seasonal -> ARIMA(p, d, q)
ARIMA seasonal -> ARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q) (m)
      * (P, D, Q) are the p,d,q values for the seasonal part
      * m -> number of periods in each season
